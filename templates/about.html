  <h2>About Cloudwich</h2>
  <p>This site is running Cloudwich.  A simple Django based wrapper around various web services, namely <a href="http://www.picasaweb.com">Picasa</a>, <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.disqus.com">Disqus.</a></p>
  <p>The idea was inspired by the PHP project <a href="http://pubwich.org/">Pubwich</a>, which does a very similar thing using PHP.  Cloudwich wraps things a bit deeper than Pubwich.  But mostly I just wanted to play with Django, so that's why I built Cloudwich.</p>
  <p>The default theme was inspired / stolen (which is it these days) from the fantastic Tumblr theme <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/631">Cavalcade</a> by <a href="http://blog.petervidani.com/">Peter Vidani</a>.</p>
  <p>You can find the source code and build your own Cloudwich site in no time flat, by grabbing the latest version from <a href="http://github.com/nicpottier/cloudwich">github</a>.
